# HeadsOrTails Bot

![](imgs/headsortails.webp)

Bot created using [Discord Py API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The idea of this bot is to be a simple simulation of the game Heads or Tails, where a player makes a guess (Heads or Tails) and keeps the remaining guess. There are 3 commands:

## Command .newgame

Reset the guesses

## Command .heads

If you are the first to take a guess, you are the player 1 with a guess "heads"; but if you are the second, you will be the second player, and the game starts.

## Command .tails

If you are the first to take a guess, you are the player 1 with a guess "tails"; but if you are the second, you will be the second player, and the game starts.
